MLMMJ is a mailing list manager notable for its low memory and CPU footprint, requiring no database. Designed to be file-managed, MLMMJ lacks a native graphical interface, though independent graphical interfaces do exist. With Yunohost, the aim is to enable comprehensive management through its configuration panel.

The Yunohost MLMMJ package is pre-configured for Yunohost's email environment. It integrates many key MLMMJ features into a user-friendly configuration panel, including:

* Subscription and unsubscription processes.
* List moderation options and digest mode.
* Customization of email subjects and footers.
* Archiving settings.
* ...

For specific functionalities not covered in the panel, users are encouraged to [open a request](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mlmmj_ynh/issues) on the package's GitHub page, fostering continuous development and customization.
