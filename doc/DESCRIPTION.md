MLMMJ is a mailing list manager notable for its low memory and CPU footprint, requiring no database. Designed to be file-managed, MLMMJ lacks a native graphical interface, though independent graphical interfaces do exist.

In this YunoHost app, a configuration panel is provided in the webadmin (in the app's info page) and allows to configure settings such as:
- Subscription and posting policy
- Moderation options
- Customization of email subjects and footers.
- Add or remove subscribers
