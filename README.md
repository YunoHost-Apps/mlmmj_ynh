## Overview

MLMMJ is a mailing list manager notable for its low memory and CPU footprint, requiring no database. Designed to be file-managed, MLMMJ lacks a native graphical interface, though independent graphical interfaces do exist.

In this YunoHost app, a configuration panel is provided in the webadmin (in the app's info page) and allows to configure settings such as:
- Subscription and posting policy
- Moderation options
- Customization of email subjects and footers.
- Add or remove subscribers

However for now, the package lacks:
- a web user interface to subscribe (for now people willing to subscribe should send an email to a special address, or ask admins to add them) 
- a web interface to browse the list's archive (but theoretically doable in the future)


**Shipped version:** 1.4.3~ynh2
